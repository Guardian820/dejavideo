Stream your own videos easily, either on your private network or to the 
world using HTML5 video.

## My use case:

I use the app to share all my videos from my main device to any devices
in the house connected to the Wi-Fi, including tablets and smartphones.

## How to use:

Copy the application on a folder on your web root and put your videos 
inside the `data/` folder (alternatively, you can create a symlink to any
folder on your system), organised in subfolders or however you prefer.
Access the app by a local URL like `192.168.?.?/dejavideo`.

## Main features:

- Supports[1] MP4, OGG and WEBM.
- Indefinitely recursive listings.
- Responsive design.
- No JavaScript involved.

[1] Actual support depends on the browser of choice. Learn more at:
